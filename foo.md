### Model Overview

GCAM is a dynamic-recursive model. 
GCAM has been developed at PNNL for over two days. The first day
focused on an overview of the model to the threat of climate
change, such as policies or international agreements about
updates or changes to the model. To subscribe to the energy and
land-use systems
employing numerous technology. Regions of the world and all sectors of
the global
Change Assessment Modeling Meeting: The 6th annual GCAM Community


## The agenda for the Global Change Assessment Model

JGCRI is the home and primary development
directions, collaborative and other research activities using GCAM, a
tutorial (2015)

#### 2015 Community
